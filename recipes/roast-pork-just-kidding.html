    <h1>Roast Pork, Just Kidding</h1>

    <p>This is Sōma's innovative dish which is served to repel the vicious urban residential planner, Yaeko Minegasaki from destroying Restaurant Yukihira. Even when after all the meat materials were sabotaged in his kitchen, Sōma managed to turn the tides by using some of the groceries as his ingredients to create artificial meat.</p>

    <h1>Recipe</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>6 white potatoes</li>
        <li>3 Eringi mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 large white onion, or 2 medium white onions.</li>
        <li>1 sprig of rosemary.</li>
        <li>Butter. I suggest 2 tablespoons (30ml), but you could always used a bit more.</li>
        <li>2 packs of thick-cut bacon.</li>
        <li>1 cup, or 250ml of red wine. We used a Pinot Noir since its preferable for cooking.</li>
        <li>1/4 cup, or 60ml of sake. Any sake that is labeled as “sweet” should do.</li>
        <li>2 tbs, or 30ml of soy sauce.</li>
        <li>1 spring of parsley or any garnish.</li>
    </ul>
